Build and install by running:

Developer Install
==========================
Installing Deluge with develop mode creates binaries that link back to the source code so changes will be reflected immediately thus no need to repeatedly install.

    $ python setup.py develop

If you wish to use a specific development directory, the following will create a Deluge install in ~/delugeDev:

export PYTHONPATH=${HOME}/delugeDev
python setup.py develop --install-dir ~/delugeDev

Refer to http://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Installing/Source for more details on alternative development options.
