Secure-Deluge is a fork of Deluge to add PKI based peer-to-peer sharing idea. More updates coming as soon as I reach somewhere. The fork is from deluge 1.3.5. All bugs in deluge are also applicable here. If someone wants to help me with rebasing this source to latest deluge, you are more than welcome to help me out.
